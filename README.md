# huffman encoding
This project was an assignment for my university Algorithms and Data Structures course.
Some of the requirements:
- Project doesn't have a main method (tests only)
- All branches must be covered with unit tests
- `JUnit4` is used for testing
- Project had to contain a `Huffman.java` class and this exact method:`public int huffman(String pathToRootDir, boolean compress)`, thats why in this class code feels unnatural, other classes are made with my coding taste =)
- It had to be able to encode file `niemanie.txt` and save encoded version to other file `niemanie - compressed.txt`
